# Rock Paper 

## Goals and Description
Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors Game! 

This is a computer vs player game where, following the rules of the game, the user and computer can score points up to 10, before one or the other wins that round. 

This game is designed to be played by someone who wants to play a simple game and doesn't have the time to play something more complex. Perhaps on portable devices like mobile phones or tablets while commuting to school or work.  It is additionally perfect for younger people, this game is simple enough in complexity that it can be played and enjoyed by anyone. The game has many variations to across the globe, swapping out the names of rock, paper and scissors for other words, or adding complexity by introducing other variables (Such as Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!). For my game, I've opted to keep the traditional 3 variable rock, paper and scissors!

Beyond testing my Javascript abilities, this website's goal is to make a well-tested and fully functioning basic game that combines functionality with clean design and colours.

## Final Thoughts

This project was very challenging for me my understanding of Javascript and for sure  I learned a lot through doing this project.  I am glad that I continued searching for the answers and didn't give up when I faced challenges, I am sure this knowledge will be very useful in my future programming career.
